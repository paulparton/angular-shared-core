# Angular Shared Core
Experimental infrastructure for sharing Angular and NGRX feature modules between multiple applications. This project is a very early work in progress, and I welcome any feedback

## The problem
Identifying a good solution for creating ngrx stores, angular feature modules and ngrx feature stores that can be shared across multiple angular applications without creating lots of extra work and compatability issues between apps.

## The proposed solution

Creating a mono-repo that contains:
 - "shared-core" providers / classes - core items for an angular application like the root ngrx store and actions
 - feature modules - modules and ngrx feature stores providing a "cohesive set of functionality focused on a specific application need"
 - library modules - collections of components and services providing reusable functionality
 - application modules - Angular applications

This allows:
 - a single base store to be shared across multiple applications.
 - feature modules with feature stores the ability to access the interface of the core store
 - the ability to use different effects in different applications to populate the store from different data sources. e.g a web app might have a HTTP SDK effect to populate the store from the server, but hybrid mobile app might populate the store from a local SQL database that is periodically synched with the server.
 - Rapid development of new applications using these building blocks
 
## Project Structure
| Folder | Description | 
| ------ | ------ | 
| src/* | The main angular application generated by the cli. This is not used as part of this project.  
| shared core | A core ngrx store and actions that are shared between the web and mobile apps
| projects/web-app | An angular application with an effect that populates the root store
| projects/mobile-app | Another angular application an effect that populates the root store
| projects/feature-module/src/lib | An angular component that shows a list of users

## Next steps
The next problem to address is building and deploying from this structure.
